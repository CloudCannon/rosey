Feature: Rosey Build Resilience
  Background:
    Given I have the environment variables:
      | ROSEY_SOURCE | dist/site            |
      | ROSEY_DEST   | dist/translated_site |

  Scenario: Rosey build ignores images without a src
    Given I have a "dist/site/index.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>
      <body>
      <p data-rosey="seal">Kiss From A Rose</p>
      <img />
      </body>
      </html>
      """
    And I have a "rosey/locales/em.json" file with the content:
      """
      {
        "seal": "ðŸ‘„ðŸŒ¹"
      }
      """
    When I run my program with the flags:
      | build |
    Then I should see a selector 'p' in "dist/translated_site/em/index.html" with the attributes:
      | data-rosey | seal |
      | innerText  | ðŸ‘„ðŸŒ¹ |

  Scenario: Complex HTML translation
    Given I have a "dist/site/index.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>

    And I should see a selector 'div > video' in "dist/translated_site/airy/index.html" with the attributes:
      | loop |  |
    And I should see '<!--Comment-->' in "dist/translated_site/airy/index.html"
    And I should see '<!DOCTYPE html>' in "dist/translated_site/airy/index.html"

  Scenario: Rosey build doesn't break in translation img srcs
