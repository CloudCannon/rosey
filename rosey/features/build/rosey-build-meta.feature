Feature: Rosey Build Meta
  Background:
    Given I have the environment variables:
      | ROSEY_SOURCE | dist/site            |
      | ROSEY_DEST   | dist/translated_site |

  Scenario: Rosey adds alternates to meta
    Given I have a "dist/site/index.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>
      </html>
      """
    And I have a "dist/site/about.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>

    And I have a "rosey/locales/blank.json" file with the content:
      """
      {}
      """
    And I have a "rosey/locales/nada.json" file with the content:

      {}

    When I run my program with the flags:
