Feature: Rosey Build Redirect

  Scenario: Rosey builds a redirect page for each file
    Given I have a "dist/site/index.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>
      </html>
      """
    Given I have a "dist/site/about.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>
      </html>
      """
    Given I have a "dist/site/contact/index.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>
      </html>
      """
    And I have a "rosey/locales/blank.json" file with the content:
      """
      {}
      """
    When I run my program with the flags:
      | build |
    Then I should see a selector 'a' in "dist/translated_site/index.html" with the attributes:
      | href      | /en/                                  |
      | innerText | Click here if you are not redirected. |
    Then I should see a selector 'a' in "dist/translated_site/about.html" with the attributes:
      | href      | /en/about.html                        |
      | innerText | Click here if you are not redirected. |
    Then I should see a selector 'a' in "dist/translated_site/contact/index.html" with the attributes:
      | href      | /en/contact/                          |
      | innerText | Click here if you are not redirected. |

      """
      {}
      """
    When I run my program with the flags:
      | build |
    Then I should see a selector 'link' in "dist/translated_site/about.html" with the attributes:
      | rel      | canonical      |
      | href     | /en/about.html |
      | hreflang | en             |

  Scenario: Rosey adds configured canonicals to redirect pages

      | href     | /blank/about.html |
      | hreflang | blank             |

  Scenario: Rosey adds meta redirect to redirect pages
    Given I have a "dist/site/about.html" file with the content:
      """
      <html>
      </html>
      """

  Scenario: Rosey build uses custom redirect page
    Given I have a "dist/site/index.html" file with the content:

    Then I should see a selector 'h1' in "dist/translated_site/index.html" with the attributes:
      | innerText | REDIRECT!!! |

  Scenario: Rosey build injects tags into custom redirect page
    Given I have a "dist/site/test.html" file with the content:
